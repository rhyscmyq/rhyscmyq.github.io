An innovative project exploring how LLMs can revolutionize fund investment strategies through real-time evaluation and benchmarking. Our work addresses the critical challenge of information leakage in LLM-driven trading strategies by implementing robust real-time testing mechanisms.

I contributed to the development of agent functionalities and system evaluation, working closely with a talented research team to enhance the system's performance and reliability. Our findings have been recognized and accepted at NeurIPS 2025, demonstrating the significant potential of LLMs in financial technology.
