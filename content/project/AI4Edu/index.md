This project breaks new ground in understanding how students solve problems by analyzing their handwriting trajectories using multimodal large language models (MLLM). By capturing and analyzing fine-grained details of students' writing processes, we've uncovered fascinating insights into problem-solving behaviors and learning patterns.

Our innovative approach to modeling handwriting trajectories has been recognized with acceptance at AIED 2025, while our deeper analysis of problem-solving behaviors is currently under review at EAAI 2026. This work represents a significant step forward in using AI to understand and enhance educational processes.
