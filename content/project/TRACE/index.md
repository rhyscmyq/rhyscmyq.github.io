TRACE (Tracking, Retrieving, and Auditing for Coherent Epics) revolutionizes long-form writing by addressing a critical challenge: maintaining narrative consistency across millions of words. Unlike traditional writing where authors manually track countless details, TRACE serves as an intelligent "guardian, not ghostwriter," automatically monitoring consistency while preserving the author's creative flow.

Through our innovative "Write, Audit, Correct" (WAC) paradigm, developed from extensive research with professional authors, TRACE leverages dynamic structured memory to provide real-time consistency checking. The system allows authors to write freely and immersively in the main writing space while acting as a vigilant safety net that flags potential inconsistencies without disrupting the creative process.

Our user study with 12 professional authors demonstrates TRACE's effectiveness in reducing cognitive load and maintaining narrative coherence, offering valuable insights for future AI tools that aim to augment rather than automate human creativity.
