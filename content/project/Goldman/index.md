Goldman introduces a multi-agent LLM framework designed to enhance decision-making in the volatile and policy-sensitive gold market. The system integrates real-time macroeconomic, policy, and market data through a three-layer architecture, enabling agents to perform domain-specific analysis and coordinated portfolio management.

By combining specialized LLM agents for market, policy, technical, and macro analysis with dynamic risk control and portfolio optimization, Goldman achieves robust, explainable, and adaptive trading strategies. Empirical validation in real-world gold trading scenarios shows that the framework consistently outperforms traditional quantitative methods, demonstrating the potential of multi-agent LLM systems in financial investment.
