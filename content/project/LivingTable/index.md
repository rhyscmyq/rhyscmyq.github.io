Researchers often face challenges in understanding academic tables, including information overload, limited interactive filtering, and a lack of context. To address these issues, we start with table analysis, conduct a multi-stage
formative study, to derive design principles. 

Living Table reimagines how researchers interact with academic papers through dynamic, interactive table visualizations. This ongoing project stems from the observation that traditional static tables often limit readers' ability to explore and understand complex research data.

By conducting extensive user research and analyzing a diverse corpus of academic papers, we've developed an innovative prototype that transforms static tables into interactive exploration tools. Our qualitative research findings, currently under review at CHI 2026, highlight how this approach significantly enhances the paper reading experience and knowledge discovery process.
