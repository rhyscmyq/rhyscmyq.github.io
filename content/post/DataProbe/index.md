This project tackles a fundamental challenge in machine learning: how to predict which datasets will yield the best results for model fine-tuning. By developing innovative probe tasks and analyzing the relationship between dataset characteristics and fine-tuning outcomes, we've created a predictive framework that helps researchers make more informed decisions about dataset selection.

Our work, currently under review at ICLR 2026, focuses on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques and introduces novel methods for dataset evaluation and selection. This research aims to make the fine-tuning process more efficient and predictable.
